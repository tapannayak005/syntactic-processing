## Identifying Entities in Healthcare Data
### This project focuses on identifying and extracting key entities from healthcare data, such as patient names, medical conditions, medications, procedures, and other relevant entities. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze healthcare records, with the goal of improving the organization and retrieval of crucial medical information.

##Features:
### *)Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extract entities like diseases, medications, and personal identifiers from healthcare texts.
###*)Data Preprocessing: Handles noisy data, including misspelled words, abbreviations, and unstructured text.
###*)Custom NER Models: Implements custom entity extraction based on domain-specific data, leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for healthcare applications.

##Libraries Used
###spaCy: Used for named entity recognition (NER) and NLP-related tasks. Provides a fast, easy-to-use solution for extracting entities.
###Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
###scikit-learn: Used for model evaluation, particularly for splitting the dataset and assessing performance metrics.
###NumPy: Efficient numerical computation, particularly for handling arrays and matrices.
###Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization and analysis of model performance.
###re (Regular Expressions): For additional text cleaning and pattern matching.

##Usage
###1)Preprocess the healthcare data using the provided preprocessing scripts.
###2)Train or fine-tune the NER model using the train_model.py script.
###3)Use the model to identify and extract entities from new healthcare text using the predict.py script.

##Dataset
###The dataset used for this project consists of anonymized healthcare records. It includes patient notes, prescriptions, and medical history, all preprocessed to remove identifiable personal information in compliance with data privacy standards.

##Results
###The model is able to achieve high accuracy in recognizing entities such as medical conditions, procedures, and medications, making it a useful tool for healthcare data analysis and clinical decision support systems.

##Future Work
Improve Entity Coverage: Expand the model to recognize more specific medical terms and entities.
Integrate with EHR Systems: Incorporate the solution into electronic health record systems for real-time entity extraction.
